Deep Learning Introduction

  Person speaking -> Microphone -> 44,000 samples per second -> Machine Learning Model

  Key components
    1. Data that the model will learn from
    2. A model of how to transform the data
    3. An objective function that quantifies how well or badly the model is doing
        - We want to get as close to 100 as possible for an optimized model
    4. An algorithm to adjust the model's parameters to optimize the objective function
