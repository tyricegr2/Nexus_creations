    "machine learning is all about uncertainty.\n",
    "In supervised learning, we want to predict\n",
    "something unknown (the *target*)\n",
    "given something known (the *features*).\n",
    "Depending on our objective,\n",
    "we might attempt to predict\n",
    "the most likely value of the target.\n",
    "Or we might predict the value with the smallest\n",
    "expected distance from the target.\n",
    "And sometimes we wish not only\n",
    "to predict a specific value\n",
    "but to *quantify our uncertainty*.\n",
    "For example, given some features\n",
    "describing a patient,\n",
    "we might want to know *how likely* they are\n",
    "to suffer a heart attack in the next year.\n",
    "In unsupervised learning,\n",
    "we often care about uncertainty.\n",
    "To determine whether a set of measurements are anomalous,\n",
    "it helps to know how likely one is\n",
    "to observe values in a population of interest.\n",
    "Moreover, in reinforcement learning,\n",
    "we wish to develop agents\n",
    "that act intelligently in various environments.\n",
    "This requires reasoning about\n",

    "*Probability* is the mathematical field\n",
    "concerned with reasoning under uncertainty.\n",

    "The use of probabilities to describe\n",
    "the frequencies of repeatable events\n",
    "(like coin tosses)\n",
    "is fairly uncontroversial.\n",
    "In fact, *frequentist* scholars adhere\n",
    "to an interpretation of probability\n",
    "that applies *only* to such repeatable events.\n",
    "By contrast *Bayesian* scholars\n",
    "use the language of probability more broadly\n",
    "to formalize our reasoning under uncertainty.\n",
    "Bayesian probability is characterized\n",
    "by two unique features:\n",
    "(i) assigning degrees of belief\n",
    "to non-repeatable events,\n",
    "e.g., what is the *probability*\n",
    "that the moon is made out of cheese?;\n",
    "and (ii) subjectivity---while Bayesian\n",
    "probability provides unambiguous rules\n",
    "for how one should update their beliefs\n",
    "in light of new evidence,\n",
    "it allows for different individuals\n",

    "Whenever we analyze a dataset, hunting for patterns\n",
    "that we hope might characterize a broader population,\n",
    "we are employing statistical thinking.\n",
    "Most courses, majors, theses, careers, departments,\n",
    "companies, and institutions have been devoted\n",

    "## A Simple Example: Tossing Coins\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we plan to toss a coin\n",
    "and want to quantify how likely\n",
    "we are to see heads (vs. tails).\n",
    "If the coin is *fair*,\n",
    "then both outcomes\n",
    "(heads and tails),\n",
    "are equally likely.\n",
    "Moreover if we plan to toss the coin $n$ times\n",
    "then the fraction of heads\n",
    "that we *expect* to see\n",
    "should exactly match\n",
    "the *expected* fraction of tails.\n",
    "One intuitive way to see this\n",
    "is by symmetry:\n",
    "for every possible outcome\n",
    "with $n_h$ heads and $n_t = (n - n_h)$ tails,\n",
    "there is an equally likely outcome\n",
    "with $n_t$ heads and $n_h$ tails.\n",
    "Note that this is only possible\n",
    "if on average we expect to see\n",
    "$1/2$ of tosses come up heads\n",
    "and $1/2$ come up tails.\n",
    "Of course, if you conduct this experiment\n",
    "many times with $n=1000000$ tosses each,\n",
    "you might never see a trial\n",
    "where $n_h = n_t$ exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the quantity $1/2$ is called a *probability*\n",
    "and here it captures the certainty with which\n",
    "any given toss will come up heads.\n",
    "Probabilities assign scores between $0$ and $1$\n",
    "to outcomes of interest, called *events*.\n",
    "Here the event of interest is $\\textrm{heads}$\n",
    "and we denote the corresponding probability $P(\\textrm{heads})$.\n",
    "A probability of $1$ indicates absolute certainty\n",
    "(imagine a trick coin where both sides were heads)\n",
    "and a probability of $0$ indicates impossibility\n",
    "(e.g., if both sides were tails).\n",
    "The frequencies $n_h/n$ and $n_t/n$ are not probabilities\n",
    "but rather *statistics*.\n",
    "Probabilities are *theoretical* quantities\n",
    "that underly the data generating process.\n",
    "Here, the probability $1/2$\n",
    "is a property of the coin itself.\n",
    "By contrast, statistics are *empirical* quantities\n",
    "that are computed as functions of the observed data.\n",
    "Our interests in probabilistic and statistical quantities\n",
    "are inextricably intertwined.\n",
    "We often design special statistics called *estimators*\n",
    "that, given a dataset, produce *estimates*\n",
    "of model parameters like probabilities.\n",
    "Moreover, when those estimators satisfy\n",
    "a nice property called *consistency*,\n",
    "our estimates will converge\n",
    "to the corresponding probability.\n",
    "In turn, these inferred probabilities\n",
    "tell about the likely statistical properties\n",
    "of data from the same population\n",
    "that we might encounter in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we stumbled upon a real coin\n",
    "for which we did not know\n",
    "the true $P(\\textrm{heads})$.\n",
    "To investigate this quantity\n",
    "with statistical methods,\n",
    "we need to (i) collect some data;\n",
    "and (ii) design an estimator.\n",
    "Data acquisition here is easy;\n",
    "we can toss the coin many times\n",
    "and record all of the outcomes.\n",
    "Formally, drawing realizations\n",
    "from some underlying random process\n",
    "is called *sampling*.\n",
    "As you might have guessed,\n",
    "one natural estimator\n",
    "is the fraction between\n",

    "\n",

    "a probabilistic model,\n",
    "generating synthetic data,\n",
    "running a statistical estimator,\n",
    "empirically assessing convergence,\n",
    "and reporting error metrics (checking the deviation).\n",
    "However, to go much further,\n",
    "we will need to be more precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with randomness,\n",
    "we denote the set of possible outcomes $\\mathcal{S}$\n",
    "and call it the *sample space* or *outcome space*.\n",
    "Here, each element is a distinct possible *outcome*.\n",
    "In the case of rolling a single coin,\n",
    "$\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{tails}\\}$.\n",
    "For a single die, $\\mathcal{S} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n",
    "When flipping two coins, we have four possible outcomes:\n",
    "$\\{(\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{heads}), (\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{tails}), (\\textrm{tails}, \\textrm{heads}),  (\\textrm{tails}, \\textrm{tails})\\}$.\n",
    "*Events* are subsets of the sample space.\n",
    "For instance, the event \"the first coin toss comes up heads\"\n",
    "corresponds to the set $\\{(\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{heads}), (\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{tails})\\}$.\n",
    "Whenever the outcome $z$ of a random experiment satisfies\n",
    "$z \\in \\mathcal{A}$, then event $\\mathcal{A}$ has occurred.\n",
    "For a single roll of a die, we could define the events\n",
    "\"seeing a $5$\" ($\\mathcal{A} = \\{5\\}$)\n",
    "and \"seeing an odd number\"  ($\\mathcal{B} = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$).\n",
    "In this case, if the die came up `5`,\n",
    "we would say that both $A$ and $B$ occurred.\n",
    "On the other hand, if $z = 3$,\n",
    "then $\\mathcal{A}$ did not occur\n",
    "but $\\mathcal{B}$ did.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A *probability* function maps events\n",
    "onto real values ${P: \\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow [0,1]}$.\n",
    "The probability of an event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
    "in the given sample space $\\mathcal{S}$,\n",
    "denoted $P(\\mathcal{A})$,\n",
    "satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$ is a non-negative real number, i.e., $P(\\mathcal{A}) \\geq 0$;\n",
    "* The probability of the entire sample space is $1$, i.e., $P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1$;\n",
    "* For any countable sequence of events $\\mathcal{A}_1, \\mathcal{A}_2, \\ldots$ that are *mutually exclusive* ($\\mathcal{A}_i \\cap \\mathcal{A}_j = \\emptyset$ for all $i \\neq j$), the probability that any of them happens is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities, i.e., $P(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{A}_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} P(\\mathcal{A}_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These axioms of probability theory,\n",
    "proposed by :citet:`Kolmogorov.1933`,\n",
    "can be applied to rapidly derive a number of important consequences.\n",
    "For instance, it follows immediately\n",
    "that the probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
    "*or* its complement $\\mathcal{A}'$ occurring is 1\n",
    "(because $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{A}' = \\mathcal{S}$).\n",
    "We can also prove that $P(\\emptyset) = 0$\n",
    "because $1 = P(\\mathcal{S} \\cup \\mathcal{S}') = P(\\mathcal{S} \\cup \\emptyset) = P(\\mathcal{S}) + P(\\emptyset) = 1 + P(\\emptyset)$.\n",
    "Consequently, the probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
    "*and* its complement $\\mathcal{A}'$ occurring simultaneously\n",
    "is $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{A}') = 0$.\n",
    "Informally, this tells us that impossible events\n",
    "have zero probability of occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When we spoke about events like the roll of a die\n",
    "coming up odds or the first coin toss coming up heads,\n",
    "we were invoking the idea of a *random variable*.\n",
    "Formally, random variables are mappings\n",
    "from an underlying sample space\n",
    "to a set of (possibly many) values.\n",
    "You might wonder how a random variable\n",
    "is different from the sample space,\n",
    "since both are collections of outcomes.\n",
    "Importantly, random variables can be much coarser\n",
    "than the raw sample space.\n",
    "We can define a binary random variable like \"greater than 0.5\"\n",
    "even when the underlying sample space is infinite,\n",
    "e.g., the line segment between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "Additionally, multiple random variables\n",
    "can share the same underlying sample space.\n",
    "For example \"whether my home alarm goes off\"\n",
    "and \"whether my house was burglarized\"\n",
    "are both binary random variables\n",
    "that share an underlying sample space.\n",
    "Consequently, knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
    "can tell us something about the likely value of another random variable.\n",
    "Knowing that the alarm went off,\n",
    "we might suspect that the house was likely burglarized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value taken by a random variable corresponds\n",
    "to a subset of the underlying sample space.\n",
    "Thus the occurrence where the random variable $X$\n",
    "takes value $v$, denoted by $X=v$, is an *event*\n",
    "and $P(X=v)$ denotes its probability.\n",
    "Sometimes this notation can get clunky,\n",
    "and we can abuse notation when the context is clear.\n",
    "For example, we might use $P(X)$ to refer broadly\n",
    "to the *distribution* of $X$, i.e.,\n",
    "the function that tells us the probability\n",
    "that $X$ takes any given value.\n",
    "Other times we write expressions\n",
    "like $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$,\n",
    "as a shorthand to express a statement\n",

    "the standard deviation has the nice property\n",
    "that it is expressed in the same units\n",
    "as the original quantity represented\n",
    "by the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the variance of a function\n",
    "of a random variable\n",
    "is defined analogously as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{Var}_{x \\sim P}[f(x)] = E_{x \\sim P}[f^2(x)] - E_{x \\sim P}[f(x)]^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our investment example,\n",
    "we can now compute the variance of the investment.\n",
    "It is given by $0.5 \\cdot 0 + 0.4 \\cdot 2^2 + 0.1 \\cdot 10^2 - 1.8^2 = 8.36$.\n",
    "For all intents and purposes this is a risky investment.\n",

    "In the same way as we introduced expectations\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, there are many things to be uncertain about!\n",
    "We can be uncertain about the value of a label given an input.\n",
    "We can be uncertain about the estimated value of a parameter.\n",
    "We can even be uncertain about whether data arriving at deployment\n",
    "is even from the same distribution as the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By *aleatoric uncertainty*, we denote that uncertainty\n",
    "that is intrinsic to the problem,\n",
    "and due to genuine randomness\n",
    "unaccounted for by the observed variables.\n",
    "By *epistemic uncertainty*, we denote uncertainty\n",
    "over a model's parameters, the sort of uncertainty\n",
    "that we can hope to reduce by collecting more data.\n",
    "We might have epistemic uncertainty\n",
    "concerning the probability\n",
    "that a coin turns up heads,\n",
    "but even once we know this probability,\n",
    "we are left with aleatoric uncertainty\n",
    "about the outcome of any future toss.\n",
    "No matter how long we watch someone tossing a fair coin,\n",
    "we will never be more or less than 50% certain\n",
    "that the next toss will come up heads.\n",
    "These terms owe to literature in mechanical modeling,\n",
    "(see e.g., :citet:`Der-Kiureghian.Ditlevsen.2009` for a review on this aspect of [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification)).\n",
    "It's worth noting that these terms constitute a slight abuse of language.\n",
    "The term *epistemic* refers to anything concerning *knowledge*\n",
    "and thus in the philosophical sense, all uncertainty is epistemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that sampling data from some unknown probability distribution\n",
    "can provide us with information that can be used to estimate\n",
    "the parameters of the data generating distribution.\n",
    "That said, the rate at which this is possible can be quite slow.\n",
    "In our coin tossing example (and many others)\n",
    "we can do no better than to design estimators\n",
    "that converge at a rate of $1/\\sqrt{n}$,\n",
    "where $n$ is the sample size (e.g., the number of tosses).\n",
    "This means that by going from 10 to 1000 observations (usually a very achievable task)\n",
    "we see a tenfold reduction of uncertainty,\n",
    "whereas the next 1000 observations help comparatively little,\n",
    "offering only a 1.41 times reduction.\n",
    "This is a persistent feature of machine learning:\n",
    "while there are often easy gains, it takes a very large amount of data,\n",
    "and often with it an enormous amount of computation to make even further gains.\n",
    "For an empirical review of this fact for large scale language models see :citet:`Revels.Lubin.Papamarkou.2016`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also sharpened our language and tools for statistical modeling.\n",
    "In the process of that we learned about conditional probabilities\n",
    "and about one of the most important equations in statistics---Bayes' theorem.\n",
    "It is an effective tool for decoupling information conveyed by data\n",
    "through a likelihood term $P(B \\mid A)$ that addresses\n",
    "how well observations $B$ match a choice of parameters $A$,\n",
    "and a prior probability $P(A)$ which governs how plausible\n",
    "a particular choice of $A$ was in the first place.\n",
    "In particular, we saw how this rule can be applied\n",
    "to assign probabilities to diagnoses,\n",
    "based on the efficacy of the test *and*\n",
    "the prevalence of the disease itself (i.e., our prior).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we introduced a first set of nontrivial questions\n",
    "about the effect of a specific probability distribution,\n",
    "namely expectations and variances.\n",
    "While there are many more than just linear and quadratic\n",
    "expectations for a probability distribution,\n",
    "these two already provide a good deal of knowledge\n",
    "about the possible behavior of the distribution.\n",
    "For instance, [Chebyshev's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality)\n",
    "states that $P(|X - \\mu| \\geq k \\sigma) \\leq 1/k^2$,\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the expectation, $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the distribution,\n",
    "and $k > 1$ is a confidence parameter of our choosing.\n",
    "It tells us that draws from a distribution lie\n",
    "with at least 50% probability\n",
    "within a $[-\\sqrt{2} \\sigma, \\sqrt{2} \\sigma]$\n",
    "interval centered on the expectation.\n",

    "1. Give an example where observing more data can reduce the amount of uncertainty about the outcome to an arbitrarily low level.\n",
    "1. Give an example where observing more data will only reduce the amount of uncertainty up to a point and then no further. Explain why this is the case and where you expect this point to occur.\n",
    "1. We empirically demonstrated convergence to the mean for the toss of a coin. Calculate the variance of the estimate of the probability that we see a head after drawing $n$ samples.\n",
    "    1. How does the variance scale with the number of observations?\n",
    "    1. Use Chebyshev's inequality to bound the deviation from the expectation.\n",
    "    1. How does it relate to the central limit theorem?\n",
    "1. Assume that we draw $n$ samples $x_i$ from a probability distribution with zero mean and unit variance. Compute the averages $z_m \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} m^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^m x_i$. Can we apply Chebyshev's inequality for every $z_m$ independently? Why not?\n",
    "1. Given two events with probability $P(\\mathcal{A})$ and $P(\\mathcal{B})$, compute upper and lower bounds on $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B})$ and $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{B})$. Hint: graph the situation using a [Venn diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram).\n",
    "1. Assume that we have a sequence of random variables, say $A$, $B$, and $C$, where $B$ only depends on $A$, and $C$ only depends on $B$, can you simplify the joint probability $P(A, B, C)$? Hint: this is a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).\n",
    "1. In :numref:`subsec_probability_hiv_app`, assume that the outcomes of the two tests are not independent. In particular assume that either test on its own has a false positive rate of 10% and a false negative rate of 1%. That is, assume that $P(D =1 \\mid H=0) = 0.1$ and that $P(D = 0 \\mid H=1) = 0.01$. Moreover, assume that for $H = 1$ (infected) the test outcomes are conditionally independent, i.e., that $P(D_1, D_2 \\mid H=1) = P(D_1 \\mid H=1) P(D_2 \\mid H=1)$ but that for healthy patients the outcomes are coupled via $P(D_1 = D_2 = 1 \\mid H=0) = 0.02$.\n",
    "    1. Work out the joint probability table for $D_1$ and $D_2$, given $H=0$ based on the information you have so far.\n",
    "    1. Derive the probability of the patient being positive ($H=1$) after one test returns positive. You can assume the same baseline probability $P(H=1) = 0.0015$ as before.\n",
    "    1. Derive the probability of the patient being positive ($H=1$) after both tests return positive.\n",
    "1. Assume that you are an asset manager for an investment bank and you have a choice of stocks $s_i$ to invest in. Your portfolio needs to add up to $1$ with weights $\\alpha_i$ for each stock. The stocks have an average return $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = E_{\\mathbf{s} \\sim P}[\\mathbf{s}]$ and covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\mathrm{Cov}_{\\mathbf{s} \\sim P}[\\mathbf{s}]$.\n",
    "    1. Compute the expected return for a given portfolio $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n",
    "    1. If you wanted to maximize the return of the portfolio, how should you choose your investment?\n",
    "    1. Compute the *variance* of the portfolio.\n",
    "    1. Formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the return while keeping the variance constrained to an upper bound. This is the Nobel-Prize winning [Markovitz portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markowitz_model) :cite:`Mangram.2013`. To solve it you will need a quadratic programming solver, something way beyond the scope of this book.\n"
